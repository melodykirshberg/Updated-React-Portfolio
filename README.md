## Description
This is my first ever portfolio implementing React.js. 

## Deployed Link
Click [here](https://verlitas.herokuapp.com).

## Technologies-Libraries
Node - Express - JavaScript - Bootstrap - CSS - HTML - React.js 

## Difficulties
While deploying this project I encountered an error with react-scripts version 3.0.0. The error will notify you that you have run into a 'An insecure WebSocket connection may not be initiated from a page loaded over HTTPS'. The work around I have found for this is to revert react-scripts back to version 3.2.0.
